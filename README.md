# Coin_Flipper
Assignment, for educational purposes only. 


## What I have learned: 
- I learned how to add colors to my color.xml folder.
- I learned that I am able to use AI to help assist me with different things such as helping me create codes for the drawable folder to add vector Icons to the project. 
- "ksp" stands for Kotlin Symbol Processing
- Learned how to upgrade my SDK 
- I have faced non-stop gradle issues, some of the methods I have learned are to Invalidate Caches, Repair the IDE, Clean Project, EndTask-Delete build folder, Do not delete the gradle script folder. 
- I have increased my understanding of variables, fragments, MVC and MVVM. 
- Configuring your app to target a recent API level ensures that users can benefit from security and performance improvements.
- Always remember to rename using refactor
- Extracting a resource makes it easier to manage and modify things like text, images, and styles throughout your app.    **eg. android:text="@string/no_internet" in layout ".xml"**
- 

## Method I use to help learn:
I each code, I want to better understand I write notes in my code and document it as I go. I understand this adds extra text content to the code, but my goal is to learn, in future code, I will minimize the text comments for efficiency. I also want to express my learnings to the instructor who will mark this assignment, to show my effort in actually learning this content. 


## Steps taken through the assignment: 
1. Add color resources, hex codes, and code.
2. Add theme xml 
3. Add vector graphics for icons, and create Icons if needed, (used AI, to create icons)
4. Had to upgrade my SDK.

6. Add BuildScript to build.gradle.kts (project) 
7. In res folder, create a resource menu, then in it create a bottom navigation resource file. 
8. Create packages and fragments (had to create a MainActivity.kt file)
9. Create layout package, and file in it "activity_crypto.xml"
10. Move the MainActivity.kt into ui package, and then create a package for fragments, and place into the ui package as well. 
11. Create 4 Fragments, ArticleFragment, SearchFragment, HeadlinesFragment, FavoritesFragment.( I may alter these, or not need as many but this is important to prep)
12. Prepare all fragments, delete any unnecessary code from the fragments to prepare them.
